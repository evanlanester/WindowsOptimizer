# WindowsOptimizer
PowerShell Script to optimize new workstations.

I have been sharing this script around with many colleagues and people in my network for years, so finally decided to create a repository for it where we can keep it up to date and available for everyone.

## Credits & Notes:
Pulling inspiration from the variety of tools out there that do a similar job.
Ranging from:
- VMWare Horizon Optimization Tool
- Built-In Tools for Windows from Microsoft.
- System Internal Tools

And other PowerShell Gurus from GitHub and PowerShell Gallery.
